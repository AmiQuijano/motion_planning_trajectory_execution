PIPELINE

1. SCANNING ENVIRONMENT:	
	Assumption: no obstacles in the predefined scanning trajectory
	Steps:
		1. MS: Joints ready - homing - start scan position top - finish
			a. homing: zeros
			b. scan position top: [0, -2.23, 0, 0, 0, 3.1, 0] ~ [0, -2.23, 0, 0, 0, -3.1, 0]
			c. scan position bottom: [-3.1, -1.3665, 0.0, 2.0024, 0.0, 1.5462, 0.0] ~ [3.1, -1.3665, 0.0, 2.0024, 0.0, 1.5462, 0.0]
		2. Start camera recording
		3. MS: Joints ready - trajectory for recording - finish
		4. Stop recording 
		5. MS: Joints ready - homing - finish
		
2. MAPPING AND MOTION PLANNING
	
	Justify: Why not in 2 different steps? what if I want to reuse the map?	

3. TRAJECTORY EXECUTION
	Steps:
		1. MS: Joints ready - homing - trajectory execution - finish
		
		
		
[0, 0, -3.1, 0.56, 0, 2.23, -3.14] ~ [0, 0, 3.1, 0.56, 0, 2.23, -3.14]
[0, 0, -3.1, 0, 0, 2.23, -3.14] ~ [0, 0, 3.1, 0, 0, 2.23, -3.14]
